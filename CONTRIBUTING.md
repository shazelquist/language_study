## Want to help out?
Currently this remains a personal project, however, if other people find it useful that is likely to change. 
Contributions should mainly be provided in the form of issues & discussion, any code will be handled in a case by case basis.
If you have any questions feel free to sent me a message or open a issue for discussion.
